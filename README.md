# go-strong-and-weak-numbers

This is a project written by me in Go language ![](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=go).
There is a program to find your **strong number** - the factorial number of which contains the ascii codes from your nickname.

**Weak number** is the number for which the number of fibonacci function calls (for 30) is closest to the sine number.

Also You can find some interesting facts about numbers.
